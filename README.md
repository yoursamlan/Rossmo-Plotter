A tool to plot and execute Rossmos's Formula, that helps to catch serial criminals using mathematics

---

Rossmo's formula is a geographic profiling formula to predict where a serial criminal lives. It relies upon the tendency of criminals to not commit crimes near places where they might be recognized, but also to not travel excessively long distances. The formula was developed and patented in 1996[1] by criminologist Kim Rossmo and integrated into a specialized crime analysis software product called Rigel.[2] The Rigel product is developed by the software company Environmental Criminology Research Inc. (ECRI), which Rossmo co-founded.[3]
